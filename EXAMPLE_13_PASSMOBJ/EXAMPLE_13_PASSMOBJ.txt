Example for DelphiDoom 2.0. (version 2.0.5.724 or higher required)
Using ACTORDEF to set PASSMOBJ flag

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example demonstrates:

-How to use ACTORDEF lumps to inherit existing ACTORS
-How to use the PASSMOBJ flag.

Inside the zip there are 2 wads:

1) LOST_SOUL_PASSMOBJ.wad
   This wad has an ACTORDEF script that add the PASSMOBJ flag to the "LOST SOUL".

2) LOST_SOUL_VANILLA.wad
   This wad has does not have the ACTORDEF script, so you can easily check the differences

With the PASSMOBJ flag the "LOST SOUL" attack is not blocked by obstacles at different heights.
Also the "LOST SOUL" attack is not interrupted by pickables (like MEDIKITS etc)
